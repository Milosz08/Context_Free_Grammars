 * Matrix generator filled with pseudo-random characters of the user-selected grammar and validator of 
 * the user-entered name, whether it is within the range of the grammar generated from the value in the edit field.

 * - the ability to change letters, special characters,
 * - toggle switches: "whether capital letters", "or numbers",
 * - the ability to change the size of the matrix (number of rows and columns),
 * - the ability to enter any text by the user,
 * - possibility to set the maximum number of special characters in a single word
 * - checking if the typed text is within the grammar range and meets the grammar criteria
 * ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 * 
 * Main assumptions:
 * - the first column of the matrix (the first character of a word) cannot be a digit or a special character,
 * - the last column of the matrix (the last character of a word) cannot end with a special character,
